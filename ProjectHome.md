This plugin enables Team Foundation Server revision control in FitNesse. The plugin is intended to perform basic operations like opening pages for edit, delete, add and revert files if neccessary. Remember that each page is defined by a directory that bears it's name, and two files that contain it's content. The first file is content.txt which holds the wiki text. The second is properties.xml which holds all the metatdata for the page. This plugin will open those files in the default changelist. The user has to take care on his own to submit these files.

This plugin is based on Markus GÃ¤rtner's PerforceCmSystem plugin see http://code.google.com/p/perforcecmsystem/

In order to use this plugin, you have to include TF.EXE in the Path when starting fitnesse
Usually adding `path=%path%;C:\Program Files\Microsoft Visual Studio 10.0\Common7\IDE`
to the StartFitNesse.cmd should do the trick.

You must also include TfsCmSystem on the classpath when starting FitNesse.
An example how to do this is included in the distribution.

When you have started up FitNesse with the TfsCmSystem in your classpath,
you have to set CM\_SYSTEM to fitnesse.wiki.cmSystems.TfsCmSystem.
This can be done in one of three ways:

1) use
> !define CM\_SYSTEM {fitnesse.wiki.cmSystems.TfsCmSystem}
> on the top-most page within FitNesse,
2) start FitNesse with -DCM\_SYSTEM=fitnesse.wiki.cmSystems.TfsCmSystem or
> some other way to set the CM\_SYSTEM property within the JVM,
3) export the environment variable CM\_SYSTEM with the content
> fitnesse.wiki.cmSystems.TfsCmSystem. How to do this is shell dependent.

After having started FitNesse with the proper classpath addition and the
CM\_SYSTEM variable defined to the TfsCmSystem class, FitNesse should use
Tfs when you add a page, edit one, refactor one, having the according
content.txt and properties.xml files being opened in the default changelist.
